2 js libs

cocos2d-js.js & cocos2d-js-min.f58cb.js 

are debug version when build (but put here to overwrite default build mininized version)

These 2 are all edited to prevent canvas from being focus anytime user touch it 
Especially useful when putting Cocos H5 game into another normal HTML page
This prevent annoying page relocating everytime users accidentally tap the game canvas (even if canvas is wrapped inside an iframe)

The editted code are in 2 places with same content:


	if(element.tagName != 'CANVAS'){
		element.focus();
	}
